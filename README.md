# AQW-AutoClick-AutoAbility

## What it does?

Not the best, not the worse... As for my first cs project, I chose to write a program that will automate keyboard and mouse actions. This is designed for AQW (Adventure quest Worlds). A game with a lot of tedious grind and endless starring at a screen keyboard smashing. As to resolve this program, will do farming **HANDS FREE**.

## How it works?

```
When you first run up the program, it will show a list of instructions:
    **********START GUIDE**********
    Welcome to AQW-AutoClick-AutoAbility

    What you can do:
    -> Automatically press abilities
    -> Automatically turn in quests

    Get started:
    Type "list" to show examples classes with their combo and delay
    Type "start" to start the program
```

```
**List** will list input for the classes I've used
**Start** starts the program
```
